### 👋 Hi, I’m Ertugrul 

I'm pretty young😉. Well I prefer to motivate me to feel 18, so I'm young :D
Despite my interest in coding, I have diverse interests in different areas.

Playing the piano, reading books, being in nature, swimming, outdoor activities, 
meeting new people, learning new languages and many more.

And a person with future goals will be bored right 🚀
  * Currently Learning Machine Learning (Andrew Ng's Course on Coursera) and Python (via Code-In-Place) 🤖
  * Waiting for my training on THW to start! ⛑️
  * Learning Sewing, want to make my own pants, the current one don't fit well and don't like them! 🪡
  * Building own Go-Kart OR a Reusable Rocket. Will be a challange but will be fun 🥳
  * Writing Newsletter on topics that I already know and think that they are benefitial for everyone to know 📮
  * Lastly one of my big goals is to learn Chinese, any tips an tricks are appreciated 😊


Feel free to reach out to me 
  * Use my socials, and or my email: erturulkucukkaya@outlook.de 📫
